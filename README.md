# Algolia Search Examples
Exploring different strategies for displaying results from an algolia index.

Current examples:
- [algolia-jquery-js client with react to display](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/scripts/bookshelf.js) ([home page](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/index.html))
- [aloglia-js client with vanilla javascript](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/scripts/bookshelf-vanillajs-search.js)  ([/search.html](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/search.html))
- [instasearch js](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/scripts/bookshelf-instasearch.js) ([/instasearch.html](https://github.com/thehelpinggroup/bookshelf/blob/master/public/instasearch.html))

Winner winner, chicken-dinner is [Instasearch.js](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/), the hot new search widget library built by Algolia. Here's an example hosted on github pages: http://getyourhelpon.com/bookshelf/

Notice the domain..that's because I have a github page setup for this org, thehelpinggroup, so it looks like it'll use that domain for any project pages. How exciting!! That means using seperate client side components..you could easily build a gallery of work or even a whole site, all in gh-pages! Might have some downsides in terms of longterm maintenance..but as far as getting started or even a full solution for simple needs, seems perfect.
